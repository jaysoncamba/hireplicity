### This is my coding exercise with hireplicity

### all of the answers for part 1 is in the 'coding_exercises.rb' and i've included some test there that can be run by this command

ruby coding_excersises.rb

### Part 2 is in basic_login directory, I've included the readme file on how to run the app there in the directory.

Thanks.
